# Reflections on Using Git

### How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It will be an easy way to see what changes may have broken or improved your code.

### What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

##### Pros
* make meaningful commits based upon sensible progress of work (e.g. one feature or bug fix completed in an hour of work or an initial commit where a project was frameworked).
* identify commits with meaningful comments, so that git logs are clear and sensible to navigate
* not a gigantic log of meaningless commits like typos

##### Cons
* easy to forget to commit often enough
